# About Me

Hello! I am Yuzhou Chang, a postdoctoral researcher at the Immuno-Oncology Informatics Group with Dr. [Qin Ma](https://u.osu.edu/bmbl/), Pelotonia Institute for Immuno-Oncology at The Ohio State University, and Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center, Harvard Medical School with Dr. [Sizun Jinag](https://sizunjianglab.com/). My research spans the intersection of **spatial omics**, **immuno-oncology**, and **computational biology**.

## Research Interests

- **Graph Signal Processing**: Leveraging graph-based methods for spatial transcriptomics analysis.
- **Spatial Omics Data Analysis**: Developing computational tools to study cell-cell communication and tissue architecture.
- **Immuno-Oncology Applications**: Utilizing spatial transcriptomics for insights into tumor-immune interactions.
- **Gene Regulatory Network Inference**: Advancing methodologies to decode gene regulation.

## Education

- **Postdoctoral Research**: Immuno-Oncology Informatics, OSU & Harvard Medical School (2024–present)
- **Ph.D.**: Biomedical Sciences, The Ohio State University (2018–2023)
  - Advisors: Prof. Qin Ma, Prof. Zihai Li
  - Training: Statistical modeling, bioinformatics, and computational systems biology
- **B.E.**: Biopharmaceutical, China Pharmaceutical University (2012–2016)

## Professional Achievements

I am the developer of tools like **SpaGFT**, a novel framework for spatial omics analysis using Graph Fourier Transform, and **RESEPT**, a deep learning framework for tissue architecture identification. 
For a full list of my publications, please visit my [Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.com/) or [GitHub](https://github.com/BMEngineeR) profiles.

## Teaching & Mentorship

I have contributed as a guest lecturer in courses such as:
- **Analysis and Applications of Genome-Scale Data** (BMI 8130), The Ohio State University
- **Applications of Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence in Biomedical Informatics** (BMI 8050)
