# About Me

Hello! I am Yuzhou Chang, a postdoctoral researcher at the Immuno-Oncology Informatics Group with Dr. [Qin Ma](https://u.osu.edu/bmbl/), Pelotonia Institute for Immuno-Oncology at The Ohio State University, and Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center, Harvard Medical School with Dr. [Sizun Jinag](https://sizunjianglab.com/). My research spans the intersection of **spatial omics**, **immuno-oncology**, and **computational biology**.

## Research Interests

- **Graph Signal Processing**: Leveraging graph-based methods for spatial transcriptomics analysis.
- **Multiplexed foundation model development and application**: develop and use a foundation model in few-shot and zero-shot cases.
- **Spatial Omics Data Analysis**: Developing computational tools to study cell-cell communication and tissue architecture.
- **Immuno-Oncology Applications**: Utilizing spatial transcriptomics for insights into tumor-immune interactions.
- **Gene Regulatory Network Inference**: Advancing methodologies to decode gene regulation.

## Education and working experiences

- **Postdoctoral Research**: Immuno-Oncology Informatics, OSU & Harvard Medical School (2024–present)
  - Advisor: Prof. Qin Ma, Prof. Sizun Jiang  
- **Ph.D.**: Biomedical Sciences, The Ohio State University (2018–2023)
  - Advisors: Prof. Qin Ma, Prof. Zihai Li
  - Training (computation): Under the umbrella of bioinformatics, graph signal processing, machine learning, deep learning, and large language models.
  - Training (biology and biotechnology): NGS sequencing (scRNA-seq and spatial transcriptomics), Immuno-oncology (lymphocyte cell fates/states in tumor microenvironment), and TCGA data mining.
- **Working**: Technician, sequencing core, Shanghai Institute of Immunology, Shanghai Jiao Tong University School of Medicine (2016-2018)
  - Advisor: Prof. Lei Chen
- **B.E.**: Biopharmaceutical, China Pharmaceutical University (2012–2016)
  - Advisor: Prof. Weihua Chu
    
## Professional Achievements

I am the developer of tools like **SpaGFT**, a novel framework for spatial omics analysis using Graph Fourier Transform, and **RESEPT**, a deep learning framework for tissue architecture identification.
