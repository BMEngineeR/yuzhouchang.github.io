  ## 🔬 Recent Research Highlights

  ### SpaGFT Framework
  Our **SpaGFT** (Spatial Graph Fourier Transform) framework continues to gain traction in the spatial omics community. This novel approach leverages graph signal processing for spatial transcriptomics analysis, enabling researchers to:
  - Identify spatially variable genes with higher precision
  - Understand cellular communication patterns
  - Decode tissue architecture at unprecedented resolution

  ### RESEPT Deep Learning Framework
  **RESEPT** (REgion SEgmentation for spatial omics via deep learning) has been instrumental in advancing tissue architecture identification. The framework provides:
  - Automated tissue region segmentation
  - Multi-scale spatial analysis capabilities
  - Integration with existing spatial omics workflows

  ### 🤝 Collaborative Research
  Currently working on exciting collaborations between:
  - **The Ohio State University** (Pelotonia Institute for Immuno-Oncology)
  - **Harvard Medical School** (Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center)
  
  These partnerships are driving innovation in **immuno-oncology informatics** and **spatial biology**.
